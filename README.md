# FinalYearProject
Instructions for Running the App:
1) Install Android Studio and open this project.
2) Navigate to Tools > AVD Manager and create a new emulator. I recommend using Nexus 6 running Android 11.0 (Release name: R), you may have to download this before proceeding.
3) Once the emulator has been created, launch it and click the three dots icon to show the extended controls.
4) Navigate to Location and search for Aston University to use as a test location. Save the point and click Set Location on the bottom right of the window.
5) The app can now be run on the emulator by clicking on the play button next to the emulator name in Android Studio.

From here, you can create your own test user by registering a new account, or you can use the details provided below.
